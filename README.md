# backgroud-ads-annoying
This is simple code to run in the console of your browser to allow the ads to not stop when you change browser tabs.

This is a complicated unessescary*(i hope in most cases) solution to annoying background ads.

Now what this code that an awesome AI wrote WONT let you do is:
-Disable the Ads entirely(audio is still there)
-Bypass and take away from the honest peoples ads revenue.
-hack spacex

With that out of the way what this snippet WILL allow you is to enjoy browsing the web or conducting courses

all while not getting pestered by having to have your browser tab and eyes glued to the darn ads!

This is for the people who dont care about the ads still playing in the backgroun(they only like 15 secs)
and are thankful that there browsing experiance isnt interupted by greedy ads.


THIS WILL break your browser use for the lolz.
